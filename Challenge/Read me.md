## Overview of Analysis 
While having vacation at Hawaii, I come up with an idea that opening a surf & shake store will allow me live in Hawaii forever. I need to investigate the precipitation and temperature data to determine whether my idea is feasible. I need to convince a investor W.Avy that this idea is profitable. 
 
## Results
The first part of the analysis is regarding the precipitation data. The analysis performed in deliverable 1 & 2 is about the temperature record in June and December. 
1. A total of 191 and 200 measurements were taken in June 2017 and December 2016 regarding temperature; which is considerably sufficient; 
2. The average temperature in June 2017 is 77 F with a standard deviation of 2.6 F; while the average temperature in December 2018 is 71F with standard deviation of 3.4 F. 
3. the lowest temperature in December 2016 is 60F.

## Summary: 
Summary to W.Avy regarding local temperature
1. The temperature in Oahu is considered high all year around and very stable ( average temperature in June and December are both above 20 0C, a small standard deviation inditates that the temperature does not swing very much)
2. Opening a surf & shake store could be a very profitable business since when temperature is high, ice creams and shakes are popular
3. Further analysis may require to confirm the consuption of ice cream and shakes and its relationship with temperature.
